# GOP Debate Bots
Using the technology outlined in Google's AI Chatbot experiment "A Neural Conversation Model", we're creating bots for Republican front-runners and setting them to debate each other!

## Instructions

We need your help building more bots, and we're providing a [Bithub bounty](http://gobithub.com/mint/gerrithall/gop-battlebots) for helping us add more training data!  

To contribute data, simply add text files to the directories according to the respective candidates. The only requirements are that it be plain text format, and the files contain content that the candidate actually wrote or said.
